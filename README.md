3. Enable the YouTube Data API v3
4. Create credentials (OAuth 2.0 client ID) for Android application
5. Add your app's SHA-1 fingerprint to the credentials

### 2. Configure the App

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Add your Google OAuth2 configuration (if needed, create `google-services.json`)
4. Build and install the app on your Android device

### 3. App Configuration

1. **Sign in with Google**: Use your Google account that has access to YouTube
2. **Select YouTube Channel**: Choose which channel to upload to (if you have multiple channels)
3. **Set Directories**:
   - Video Directory: Path where MP4 files are stored
   - Subtitle Directory: Path where SRT files are stored
   - Processed Directory: Path where uploaded files will be moved
3. **Configure Upload Settings**:
   - Upload Interval: How often to check for new files (in minutes)
   - Privacy Status: private, public, or unlisted
   - **Delete After Upload**: Option to permanently delete original files after successful upload
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This option permanently deletes your original files
     - Alternative: Files can be moved to a "processed" directory instead

## File Management Options

The app provides two options for handling files after successful upload:

1. **Move to Processed Directory** (Default): 
   - Original files are moved to a designated "processed" directory
   - Files are preserved and can be recovered if needed
   - Recommended for most users

2. **Delete After Upload**:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Permanently deletes** original files after successful upload
   - Saves storage space but cannot be undone
   - Use with caution - ensure you have backups if needed

## File Matching

- `video.mp4` will be matched with `video.srt`
- Files without matching subtitles will be uploaded without captions
